# Frontend Exercise

VoteShield Frontend Engineer job search take-home exercise.

## Instructions

Create a reusable, accessible, mobile-friendly "Word Lookup" component. This component should provide an input that looks up the definition of a word provided by an API and then displays the definition.

- There are no constraints on frameworks or libraries you can use.
- Should utilize whatever API you prefer, but an easy, free one is [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
- Should provide an easy way to run the component in isolation locally.
- Should have some at least some minimal design and styling; feel free to assume/include a larger existing design system such as Bootstrap.
- The project should be easily usable by other developers.
- Please provide brief explanation of assumptions and choices made throughout the project in the `README.md` or a `NOTES.md` file.

## Goals

The main goal of this exercise is to allow you to demonstrate your ability to design basic, usable, accessible, cross-device interfaces, and your ability to write high-quality code that fits into a larger system and can easily be used by others.

This exercise is purposefully a bit open-ended to allow for creative problem-solving and to understand your previous experience. We understand that each person may have assumptions about the requirements, but we also want to assess those assumptions as well as your ability to execute on the exercise. We encourage you to communicate any assumptions as suggested in the "Instructions". There will be time to discuss your solution if you move forward in the hiring process.

Do not hesitate to ask questions about the exercise if you feel you need more guidelines on any part; we realize that in a practical environment, user input and iteration would be critical to success.

## Time-frame

You should block off about 2 hours for this exercise. If you feel you could do more regardless of the time-frame, please put information in the `README.md` or a `NOTES.md` file that briefly explains what more you would do given extra time. It is reasonable to not be able to completely "finish" this exercise in the alloted time-frame.

## Submission

You should have received explicit instructions on how to submit your work from the VoteShield hiring team.
