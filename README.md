# Frontend Exercise

VoteShield Frontend Engineer job search take-home exercise.

## Instructions

Create a standalone, reusable "Word Lookup" component. This component should provide an input that looks up the definition of a word provided by an API and then display the definition.

- Should utilize whatever API you prefer, but an easy, free one is [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
- Please provide brief explanation of choices made throughout the project in the `README.md` or a `NOTES.md` file.

## Goals

The goal of this exercise is to allow you to demonstrate not just your ability to produce high-quality, accessible, cross-device code but to also show your ability to write code that fits into a larger system and used by others on a team or externally.

This exercise is purposefully open-ended and vague to allow for creative problem-solving, though there is a number of implicit expectations set in the "goals" statement above. Do not hesitate to ask questions if you feel you can't make decisions without external input; in a practical environment, user input and iteration would be critical to success.

## Time-frame

You should block off about 2 hours for this exercise. If you feel you could do more regardless of the time-frame, please put information in the `README.md` or a `NOTES.md` file that briefly explains what more you would do given extra time. It is reasonable to not be able to completely "finish" this exercise in the alloted time-frame.

## Submission

You should have received explicit instructions on how to submit your work from the VoteShield hiring team.
